2. Analogies and Metaphors: Employ relatable analogies and metaphors to explain technical concepts, making them more accessible and understandable.
3. High-Level Overview: Provide a broad, introductory overview of the technology, focusing on its practical applications and benefits.
4. Avoid Assumptions: Don't assume prior knowledge; instead, start with the basics and gradually build upon them.

For a Mixed Audience:
1. Layered Explanation: Offer a layered explanation, starting with a simplified overview and gradually increasing the level of technical detail.
2. Visual Aids: Use visual aids like diagrams, flowcharts, and infographics to help illustrate complex technical concepts and make them more accessible.
3. Glossary or Resources: Provide a glossary or additional resources for those who want to delve deeper into the technical aspects.
